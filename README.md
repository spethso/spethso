### Hello there, my name is Sandro ðŸ‘‹

I am currently research assistant at the [Software Quality and Architecture Group](https://www.iste.uni-stuttgart.de/sqa/team/Speth) of the University of Stuttgart in Germany. 
Additionally, I am Gold [Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador](https://studentambassadors.microsoft.com/de-DE/profile/218) and Co-founder of the [Microsoft Campus Community](https://campus-community.org/), a German program for technology-interested students, where I am leading the Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg hub.

My general research interests are Component-based and (Micro-)Service-oriented Software Architectures, Software Quality, and Issue Management. 
More specific, I am interested in (1) how to automate the management of issues that affect multiple components, i.e. Cross-Component Issues, (2) how to identify the propagation of software quality violations, e.g. performance SLO violations, and (3) analysing their impact on entire architectures. For a list of my publications and supervised students' works, please checkout my [university page](https://www.iste.uni-stuttgart.de/sqa/team/Speth). ðŸ”­
